# 🔧 Verilog VLSI Projects

This repository contains my Verilog programs for digital design and VLSI fundamentals. These projects are part of my learning journey towards becoming a VLSI RTL Design Engineer.

## 📁 Structure

Each folder contains:
- Verilog source code (`.v`)
- Testbench files
- Simulation results (e.g., `.vcd`, screenshots)
- Explanation of logic

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Icarus** (for simulation)
- Text Editor: VS Code


✅ Each project is verified using testbenches and waveform simulation.

## 📚 Learning Goals

- Master combinational and sequential logic
- Practice writing modular and reusable Verilog code
- Understand synthesis vs simulation
- Explore RTL design flow
